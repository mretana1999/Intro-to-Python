        "In this assignment #7 we designed an OOP solution to arithmetic operations involving colors. This operations involve color process in which the primarily colors [Red, Green, and Blue] are added or subtracted in order to create new colors like cyan, yellow, or magenta. For example, if we combine red with green the final result would be yellow.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "The solution consisted in the creation of a class that we named 'color'. The constructor is in the function __init__ which coerce values into the required range by saturating. The addition function adds the RGB values and it makes sure that the values are normalizeed [values between 0 and 1]. The subtraction function that is inside the class takes the difference in between the color 1 and the color 2, it returns a new color object. The function __str__ converts the data into readable string. The function __repr__  prints a representation of x.  The function input_color, gets a single input color from user of format (r,g,b) or color name from color_dict and returns a color object with specified attributes. Finally, the pretty print function that makes the data more readable.\n",

        "---\n",
        "In the program, we ask the user to enter two colors [by name or by RBG values] and then we compute the difference of the colors to produce a result. Since the RGB values are normalized, the numbers will always be in between 0 and 1. The answer is displayed as RGB value or as a color name [if any]. The final solution is pretty printed for better visual effects.\n",

A future improvement would be the expansion of the dictionary so more colors would be represented with their name."
